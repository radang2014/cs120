Couple notes:
 - I used the Heroku random word API to fetch a random 5-letter word for the answer
 - I did NOT use any API for word validation (as the requirements only stated to do one)
 - If the API call fails for whatever reason (e.g. Internet connection broke while playing 
   the game), I have a hard-coded array of words as a back-up 
 - I have implemented both extra credit features (used letter board and average guesses on device).
   The average guesses on device does not show up until at least one winning game has been 
   achieved.
