        <h3>Trip / Getaway</h3>
        <p>
            About 5 months ago, my parents and I took a day trip to Block Island (an 3x7 mile 
            island located south of the mainland portion of Rhode Island). We drove to a port 
            at Point Judith to take a one hour long ferry to the island and rented bikes for 
            the day as our primary mode of transporation within the island. During our excursion, 
            we briefly visited multiple historical sites, mini-zoos, beaches, lighthouses, and 
            trailheads.
        </p>

        <h3>Favorite Pet Names</h3>
        <em>I have no experience naming pets so sorry if these are bad.</em>
        <ul>
            <li>A dog named Sally</li>
            <li>A cat named Larry</li>
            <li>A fish named Bob</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Favorite Restaurant</h3>
        <p>
            My favorite restaurant is Nijiya Sushi:
            <a href="https://www.nijiyasushi.net/" target="_blank">https://www.nijiyasushi.net/</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I love this restaurant because I love sushi, but I always feel the need to eat it in 
            moderation due to how expensive it is. Since Nijiya has a pretty good all you can eat 
            deal, this is a place where I can enjoy as much sushi as I want in one meal. The sushi 
            quality is pretty good too.
        </p>

        <p>
            I like to serve Chicken Parm with a serving of Penne Pasta cooked in Marinara Sauce, 
            and to top it all with some Crushed Red Pepper and grated Parmesan Cheese. I 
            eat the chicken with a fork and knife, and eat the pasta with a fork.
