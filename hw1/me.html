            Hello! I wanted to take CS 120 because I wanted to learn 
            more about the process of building Web applications, particularly 
            applications that involve server-side programming. Most of the CS 
            courses that I have taken (both as an undergraduate and graduate 
            student at Tufts) focus on low-level systems topics, so much of my 
            software engineering experience coming into this course are from 
            that realm. I have built simple websites using HTML, JavaScript, 
            and little bit of CSS but have remained within the realm of 
            client-side programming. I am hoping to use what I learn in this 
            course to effectively build websites and Web applications that will 
            serve me in my future endeavors.
